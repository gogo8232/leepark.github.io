This github page is for any .py files that I made as a graduate students at Uky.

First of all, I made STA296_GUI to have a simple calculator for statistical analysis so that I don't have to code everything whenever I need to calculate simple stuffs. STA296_GUI.py is a GUI program, so you can just run it and enjoy.

I am now interested in writing a stock price analysis program, which will predict the price of Natural gas and trading analysis for UVXY.

I trade options for both, so it is purely for safe and profitable option trading. 

This is a collaborative project and my team is being testing the model; and hopefully profiting our of actual trading.

The program is not open to public yet; however, if you want to look it up under the condition that you never share this with others, please contact me via email (lee.park@uky.edu)
